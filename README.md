# My Docker Files
This is a collections of docker files that I have put together to help with
different needs that are not directly part of a given project.  I will try and
put examples of how I use them and a README for each one.

* [godev](https://hub.docker.com/r/bzvestey/godev/) - This is a used to rebuild
and start go project every time you save a .go file.  Mac and Linux only,
because of a limitation on how the file sharing between Windows and the Docker
box.
